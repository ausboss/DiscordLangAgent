# DiscordLangAgent
This is a Discord chatbot built with LangChain. It uses the Agent features in LangChain to create flexible conversation chains based on user input. The bot can interact with different language models and tools, and supports multiple API endpoints. It's designed with customization in mind, allowing for the addition and modification of features as needed. The project is a hobby, developed with an open-source ethos and shared for anyone interested in exploring the capabilities of language models in a chatbot context.
